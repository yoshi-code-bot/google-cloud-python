class Source(proto.Message):
    r"""Security Command Center finding source. A finding source
    is an entity or a mechanism that can produce a finding. A source
    is like a container of findings that come from the same scanner,
    logger, monitor, and other tools.

    Attributes:
        name (str):
            The relative resource name of this source. See:
            https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/resource_names#relative_resource_name
            Example:
            "organizations/{organization_id}/sources/{source_id}".
        display_name (str):
            The source's display name.
            A source's display name must be unique amongst
            its siblings, for example, two sources with the
            same parent can't share the same display name.
            The display name must have a length between 1
            and 64 characters (inclusive).
        description (str):
            The description of the source (max of 1024
            characters). Example:

            "Web Security Scanner is a web security scanner
            for common vulnerabilities in App Engine
            applications. It can automatically scan and
            detect four common vulnerabilities, including
            cross-site-scripting (XSS), Flash injection,
            mixed content (HTTP in HTTPS), and outdated or
            insecure libraries.".
        canonical_name (str):
            The canonical name of the finding source. It's either
            "organizations/{organization_id}/sources/{source_id}",
            "folders/{folder_id}/sources/{source_id}", or
            "projects/{project_number}/sources/{source_id}", depending
            on the closest CRM ancestor of the resource associated with
            the finding.
